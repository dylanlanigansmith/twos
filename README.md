### twOS (two OS)

I write another operating system from scratch, because this is fun right?


Ideas:

- memory management before anything else
    - pmm done
    - vmm 
        - page faults ?
        - malloc
        - map arbitrary page tables/pages
            - look at randos 
                - how was it used 
        - vm_alloc
        - still have to bootstrap
            - map given tables to make heap
                - with heap we can map whatever
            

    modules?
